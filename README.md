# makefile_creator
This is a program that is men to help my friends gain time in their projects by automating the makefile and header creation with this python script.

## Keep in mind:

a version of python 3 is required
a graphical interface will be comming soon
Tkinter is required for the graphical interface

## Need help:
Run the program with the -h option
